        Hey! <br> <br> I'm Aleksei. I'm 27 and I'm Web Developer. <br> I've started coding 2 months ago. I had known nothing about web development. However now I've created this very simple HTML Web Pages site.

    <p>
        I'm glad that I entered the IT field and can gain good skills and new experience. I will take a full course in web development and become a professional web developer. <br> <br>
        See you later guys!
